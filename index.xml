I&amp;rsquo;m glad more people are interested in this. See the discussion here
Some people expressed interest in my org roam notes workflow. Setting this up has been an interesting project, teaching me about Emacs, org-mode and a little about web frontend. This post will describe my current workflow in as much details as possible.</description></item><item><title>Open-ended creation of hybrid creatures with Neural Cellular Automata</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/blog/open-ended-creation-of-hybrid-creatures-with-neural-cellular-automata/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 15:25:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/blog/open-ended-creation-of-hybrid-creatures-with-neural-cellular-automata/</guid><description>This post describes my submission to the Minecraft Open-endedness challenge 2021. The submission was evaluated with the video below and the code here. This post will detail the methods and tools used for the submission and give hints for future work.
If you want a quick description of the work, have a look at the video:
Introduction Motivation My current research deals with evolution in complex systems and specifically cellular automata (CA).</description></item><item><title>The Elegance of Optimal Transport</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/blog/the-elegance-of-optimal-transport/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2019 23:20:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/blog/the-elegance-of-optimal-transport/</guid><description>This post was largely inspired by Gabriel Peyré and Marco Cuturi&amp;rsquo;s excellent book about Computational Optimal Transport, which is free, (arXiv link, ref: [1]).
A simple problem? Let&amp;rsquo;s start at the beginning: what is Optimal transport (OT)?
It all begins with Gaspard Monge, reading his mémoire [2] in front of eminent scientists and engineers of the time &amp;mdash; including famous Enlightenment philosopher Condorcet &amp;mdash; at the French Académie Royale des Sciences in 1776.</description></item></channel></rss>
