Lecture</h3>
<p>This talk was very similar to another one I watched from
<a href="/notes/santa_fe_institute/">Santa Fe Institute</a> which
promotes her book: <a href=
"/notes/talk_artificial_intelligence_a_guide_for_thinking_humans/">Artificial
Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans</a>.</p>
<p>It gives a detailed breakdown of why machine learning still
fails at many tasks and might not be able to overcome them before
we change the current way of doing it. The main takeaway for me is
that Mitchell believes we will need to somehow build abstraction or
conceptualization capabilities within our ML models to make them
able to use “common sense” and understand things we consider as
basic.</p>

series as appropriate models for environmental variation in
artificial evolutionary systems</h4>
<p>Many biological time-series exhibit a type of colored <a href=

functions in evolutionary models and observe that it profoundly
affect the evolutionary response. This is interesting because it
shows that the most often used white noise (Gaussian noise) might
not be the best choice for evolution simulations.</p>

Acacia Ackles, Austin Ferguson, Connor Grady, Charles Ofria - Rank
epistasis: A new model for analyzing epistatic interactions in the
absence of quantifiable fitness interactions</h4>
<p>This paper studies an <a href="/notes/epistasis/">epistasis</a>
model. The new proposed model is based on ranking loci of a genetic
model based on their fitness. Then, after mutating a locus and
computing the new ranking. By comparing statistical differences
between the two rankings one can estimate the effect of the
previously introduced mutation.</p>
<p>The authors used <a href="/notes/nk_model/">NK model</a> to
study the new metric in a relatively well studied environment.
Sites with higher epistatic activity score higher according to
their metric and this happens without any a priori information
about how the sites interact with each other.</p>

Mahi Luthra, Eduardo J. Izquierdo, Peter M. Todd - Cognition
Evolves with the Emergence of Environmental Patchiness</h4>
<p>Using a simple agent based simulation of animals and plants in a
grid world, the authors observe spontaneous “patchiness” of the
partition of plants. Cognition, defined as the ability perceptual
strength of an agent and the stochasticity of its decisions
increases and stabilizes in those simulations.</p>
<p>When cognition is not restricted, patches are larger and more
visible, whereas for restricted cognition resource distribution is
more uniform. There is a two way influence of both parameters on
the evolution of patches and cognition.</p>

Lauren Benso, Lauren Benson, Madhavun Candadai and Eduardo
Izquierdo - Neural reuse in multifunctional circuits for control
tasks</h4>
<p>This talk is about studying a simple two-layers feedforward
neural network evolved to solve three RL tasks at the same time.
Then by introducing neuron lesions and their effect on the fitness,
one is able to identify the useful neurons and their
importance.</p>
<p>Many neurons are re-used across multiple tasks. With neural
variance and mutual information within each neurons the authors are
able to analyze the reuse of neurons.</p>
<p>The takeaways are :</p>
<ul>
<li>It seems relatively simple to obtain neuron reuse across tasks
with simple evolutionary methods</li>
<li>Successful neural networks on theses toy tasks appear to reuse
their neurons</li>
</ul>

within groups of elements (instead of pairs). This allows studying
contagion and spreading dynamics from a new angle.</p>

Oskar Elek, Joseph N. Burchett, J. Xavier Prochaska and Angus G.
Forbes - Monte Carlo Physarum Machine: Agent-based Model for
Reconstructing Complex 3D Transport Networks</h4>
<p>Cosmic web is diffuse, not only composed of galaxies but hot and
cold gas and dark matter. It is very hard to capture from
experimental data. Authors use the slime mold as a model for
reconstructing this network. This mold is interesting because by
using gradients of chemicals emitted by food and itself, it can
construct near-optimal transport networks. Their model is also
inspired from Sage Jensons’s cyber critters adapted to 3D. They use
Monte-carlo sampling of directions around the gradient for moving
each tiny agent which results in more natural-looking
simulations.</p>
<p>This model reproduces the cosmic web in a relatively faithful
way visually, and is robust thanks to its stochastic component.</p>

<p>This poster is about characterizing the computational
capabilities of reservoir computing systems. The author’s goal is
to design computational substrates that have interesting properties
when used as reservoir computing basis.</p>
<p>For this, the authors have to define a behavior space that they
slice up into voxels. They use novelty search to explore that space
and measure the quality of the possible behavior.</p>
