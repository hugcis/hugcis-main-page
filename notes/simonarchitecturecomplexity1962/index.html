<h2 id="complex-systems">Complex systems</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In such systems, the whole is more than the sum of the parts,
not in an ultimate, metaphysical sense, but in the important
pragmatic sense that, given the properties of the parts and the
laws of their interaction, it is not a trivial matter to infer the
properties of the whole. In the face of complexity, an in-principle
reductionist may be at the same time a pragmatic holist.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="complexity-as-hierarchy">Complexity as hierarchy</h2>
<p>Hierarchy is one of the central structural schemes of
complexity.</p>
<p>Structures of a complex system are made of interrelated
substructures, each of which are also made of subsystems, etc.
Until some elementary particle level is reached.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In most systems in nature, it is somewhat arbitrary as to where
we leave off the partitioning, and what subsystems we take as
elementary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Different things might be considered elementary depending on
what is being studied. Ex: cells, stars, atoms can all be used as
elementary subsystems for biology, astronomy and chemistry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most physical and biological hierarchies are described in
spatial terms. We detect the organelles in a cell in the way we
detect the raisins in a cake — they are “visibly” differentiated
substructures localized spatially in the larger structure. On the
other hand, we propose to identify social hierarchies not by
observing who lives close to whom but by observing who interacts
with whom. These two points of view can be reconciled by defining
hierarchy in terms of intensity of interaction, but observing that
in most biological and physical systems relatively intense
interaction implies relative spatial propinquity.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id=
"complex-systems-and-emergence-through-evolutionary-processes">
Complex systems and emergence through evolutionary processes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The “improbability” of evolution has nothing to do with this
quantity of entropy, which is produced by every bacterial cell
every generation. The irrelevance of quantity of information, in
this sense, to speed of evolution can also be seen from the fact
that exactly as much information is required to “copy” a cell
through the reproductive process as to produce the first cell
through evolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is much easier to create complex hierarchies with <a href=
"/notes/evolution/">Evolution</a>, because subsystems are stable
stepping stones from which new larger system can emerge. On the
other hand, creating a very complex system from scratch is very
unlikely.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is selectivity in the evolutionary process,
mainly due to two causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building blocks are stable, and passively guide further
evolution</li>
<li>Reproduction is possible in many complex systems, allowing
transmission of experience from past complex hierarchies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The argument can be turned around by saying that predominance of
hierarchies in complex systems is simply a result of properties of
the evolutionary process.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-properties-of-hierarchically-organized-systems">
Dynamic properties of hierarchically-organized systems</h2>
<p>Some systems are <em>decomposable</em>. This means that it can
be seen as a sum of independent subsystems made of elementary
particles. This is often not very accurate and we can also use the
theory of <em>nearly decomposable</em> systems, where subsystems
interact weakly.</p>
<p>This is often useful for separating high-frequency dynamics
(usually within the subsystems) of a hierarchy from its
low-frequency dynamics (interactions between subsystems).</p>
<h2 id="relations-between-complex-systems-and-their-descriptions">
Relations between complex systems and their descriptions</h2>
<p>For nearly decomposable systems, little information is lost by
representing them as hierarchies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there are important systems in the world that are complex
without being hierarchic, they may to a considerable extent escape
our observation and our understanding. Analysis of their behavior
would involve such detailed knowledge and calculation of the
interactions of their elementary parts that it would be beyond our
capacities of memory or computation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Complex systems often admit simple descriptions (relative to the
initial complexity). One of the main simplification mechanism is
redundancy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If genetic material is a program — viewed in its relation to the
organism — it is a program with special and peculiar properties.
First, it is a self-reproducing program ; we have already
considered its possible copying mechanism. Second, it is a program
that has developed by Darwinian evolution. On the basis of our
watchmaker’s argument, we may assert that many of its ancestors
were also viable programs — programs for the subassemblies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/notes/ontogeny_recapitulates_phylogeny/">Ontogeny
recapitulates phylogeny</a>: some problem can be reduced to
previously solved problems. <a href=
"/notes/evolution/">Evolution</a> can take solutions to previous
problems and use it to solve new problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How complex or simple a structure is depends critically upon the
way in which we describe it. Most of the complex structures found
in the world are enormously redundant, and we can use this
redundancy to simplify their description. But to use it, to achieve
the simplification, we must find the right representation. The
notion of substituting a process description for a state
description of nature has played a central role in the development
of modern science. Dynamic laws, expressed in the form of systems
of differential or difference equations, have in a large number of
cases provided the clue for the simple description of the complex.
In the preceding paragraphs I have tried to show that this
characteristic of scientific inquiry is not accidental or
superficial. The correlation between state description and process
description is basic to the functioning of any adaptive organism,
to its capacity for acting purposefully upon its environment. Our
present-day understanding of genetic mechanisms suggests that even
in describing itself the multi-cellular organism finds a process
description — a genetically encoded program — to be the
parsimonious and useful representation.</p>
