            <h2 id="why-should-we-care-about-open-endedness">Why should we care about open-endedness?</h2>
            <blockquote>
              <p>There is nothing you can point to that would be worth coming back to a billions year from now to see what happened. And yet, we are inside of such a system and such a system produced us.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><a href="/notes/evolution/">Evolution</a> is a seemingly <a href="/notes/open_ended_evolution/">open-ended</a> process for which we only have access to a single run’s current and past results. It is this algorithm capable of generating endless surprises over the course of billions of years.</p>
            <p>But open-endedness also happens outside of “strict” evolution. It has been in the history of art, science, technology. We as humans are both a product of an open-ended process and also open-ended ourselves.</p>
            <h2 id="how-to-achieve-it">How to achieve it?</h2>
            <p><strong>No algorithm yet exists worth running forever.</strong> We haven’t been able to create open-endedness yet.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Usually there is an objective function which means the algorithm converges or get stuck.</li>
              <li>Even other more innovative ideas end up reaching diminishing returns (<a href="/notes/co_evolution/">co-evolution</a>, self-play, <a href="/notes/generative_adversarial_networks/">GANs</a>, <a href="/notes/artificial_life/">Alife worlds</a>)
              </li>
              <li>This is true for deep learning, optimization, evolution, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So far, it seems we still don’t know something.</p>
            <h3 id="early-insights-with-neat--neat-dot-md">Early insights with <a href="/notes/neat/">NEAT</a></h3>
            <p>What this algorithm tells us is: for a thing to be open-ended, it needs to be unbounded. It has to be possible to make more complex things.</p>
            <h3 id="picbreeder--picbreeder-dot-md"><a href="/notes/picbreeder/">Picbreeder</a></h3>
            <p>An experiment about letting people “breed” pictures (with <a href="/notes/neat/">NEAT</a> evolving <a href="/notes/cppn/">CPPN</a>s under the hood).</p>
            <p>An important fact is people were never actively looking for the final product when obtaining interesting pictures.</p>
            <h3 id="novelty-search--novelty-search-dot-md"><a href="/notes/novelty_search/">Novelty search</a></h3>
            <p>The idea is to do divergent search instead of convergent search and remove the objective function. It sometimes appear to solve better than optimization.</p>
            <p>There is also a need for stepping stone collectors (SSCs). This is a process that store the results in a growing archive. The more stepping stones you have, the more places you can get to. In a way, picbreeder and natural evolution are stepping-stone collectors.</p>
            <p>This eventually led to <a href="/notes/quality_diversity/">Quality diversity</a>. This transition happened because there was still a need to communicate if the system is doing what we want.</p>
            <p>However, QD is certainly not one of those algorithms worth running for a billion years. The space of possibilities gets filled progressively and there is no new possibility arising.</p>
            <h2 id="towards-achieving-earth-s-creativity">Towards achieving Earth’s creativity</h2>
            <p>On Earth, evolution is simultaneously creating new opportunities and possibilities <strong>and</strong> searching through them.</p>
            <p>This idea led to Minimal Criterion Co-evolution algorithms. They used the example of mazes and <a href="/notes/neural_networks/">neural networks</a> that drive robots through the mazes. Those two form two populations that can evolve. This is not really like what happens in nature where a tree is both a “problem” and a “solution”, but is OK in a machine learning context. There is a <em>minimal criterion</em> only:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The maze has to be solved</li>
              <li>The solver has to solve mazes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When any of those pass the minimal criterion, they get to reproduce. This is inspired by Nature where the minimal criterion is reproduction.</p>
            <p>This MCC seems to give algorithms worth running for several years.</p>
            <p>Recent work added a resource limitation:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>A maze can only be used a finite amount of time by maze solvers in order to solve the minimal criterion.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This pushes towards diversity in a much better way than enforced speciation.</p>
