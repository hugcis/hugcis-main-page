<h2 id="my-idea-of-open-ended-evolution">My idea of Open Ended
evolution</h2>
<p>As part of my research, I have been thinking a lot about
open-ended evolution and what this concept means to me. Although it
is still early in my research journey, I will go into the process
of <a href="/notes/writing/">writing</a> down my thoughts about
this very challenging concept in order to have material on which I
will be able to reflect later and understand how my beliefs have
changed.</p>
<p>I see open-ended evolution (OEE) as the holy grail of <a href=
"/notes/artificial_life/">Artificial life</a> (and maybe <a href=
"/notes/artificial_intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>)
research. The only manifestation of intelligence we know of has
emerged through a long and <a href="/notes/complexity/">complex</a>
process, which inner workings we seem to understand. This process
is often called <a href="/notes/evolution/">evolution</a> and
sometimes reduced to one of its components: <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%5Fselection">Natural
Selection</a>. Evolution obviously encompasses much more, starting
from the process through which new characters and behaviors can
emerge.</p>
<p>When people from the <a href="/notes/computer_science/">computer
science</a> community refer to OEE, they usually mean
<strong>artificial</strong> OEE. That is, the creation of
artificial systems (usually computer simulations?) that can exhibit
the same properties as natural evolution. The main problem is:
<em>What are those properties?</em>. I know many researchers have
spent a lot of time figuring this out, and this part of the problem
is certainly the most important one. As Hiroki Sayama once told me,
citing another Alife researcher: <em>Give me a definition of OEE
and I can build it</em>. Here are some properties I would expect
from an open-ended system from the top of my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to grow in complexity. From a given state of the
system, we can expect it to grow in complexity by building on
previous complexity and adding innovations. <strong>This is
probably the biggest open question</strong>, because although we
can easily think about systems that keep generating novel things,
we don’t know if they can grow in complexity. And even for things
where there is evidence that it is possible, we don’t know how
efficient they are.</li>
<li>Adaptability to new environmental conditions. The system should
have some amount of plasticity, or capability to change its
internal functions in response to a change in external conditions.
It is hard to tell if this is just a spontaneous property of
systems satisfying the condition above or something more?</li>
<li>Ability to communicate information to the outside of the system
(this is not required for any OEE system per se but necessary if we
want to be able to get something out of the simulation). One could
also argue that complexity means nothing without an observer.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is certainly not complete, and probably not correct.
But I believe these objectives are already hard enough to make the
scientific challenge they represent exciting. I believe the
<a href="/notes/cellular_automata/">cellular automata</a> I am
studying have the potential to qualify for the first property and
the third. However, it is still not clear how efficient this can be
and if it is within reach.</p>
