<h2 id="what-can-computers-do">What can computers do?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The fallacy under discussion is the widespread superstition that
we can’t write a computer program to do something unless one has an
extremely clear, precise formulation of what is to be done, and
exactly how to do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is generally believed that <a href="/notes/coding/">computer
programs</a> cannot be more than a set of rules and instructions
for what to do in a given computer state. While this is true, it
falls into the common pitfall of thinking of the whole as the sum
of its parts</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, for more advanced processes, while “perfectly” true in
one sense, it would be as correct to say that “houses are nothing
but arrangements of construction materials” or “books are merely
long strings of words.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minsky discusses three ways to see a computer program</p>
<h2 id="a-program-as-a-sequence-of-instruction-to-be-obeyed">A
program as a sequence of instruction to be obeyed</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common and simple-minded view is that a computer
program is a sequence of clear-cut operations to be performed on
some data.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-program-as-a-court-of-law">A program as a court of
law</h2>
<p>The author now gives an example program that can accumulate
facts from user input. A disambiguation “part” of the program acts
as a court, weighing different facts against previously accumulated
knowledge and adding it to its database.</p>
<p>In large programs with many such subprograms, it is clear that
the whole isn’t behaving like a sequence anymore. The programmer
only constructs the laws and rules that will guide those courts but
usually cannot predict or understand the details of operations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For try as we may, we rarely can fully envision, in advance, all
the details of [the subprograms'] interactions. For that, after
all, is why we need computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-program-as-a-collection-of-statements-of-advice">A
program as a collection of statements of advice</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The great illusion shared not only by all terrified humanists
but also by most computer “experts,” that programming is an
inherently precise and rigid medium of expression, is based on an
elementary confusion between form and content. If poets were
required to write in units of fourteen lines, it wouldn’t make them
more precise; if composers had to use all twelve tones, it wouldn’t
constrain the overall forms; if designers had to use only fourth
order surfaces no ‑one would notice it much! It is humorous, then,
to find such unanimity about how the rather stiff grammar of (the
older) programming language makes for precision in describing
processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to note that it seems that in Minsky’s mind,
<a href="/notes/coding/">programming</a> would have more flexible
syntax in the future approaching natural language more
accurately.</p>
<p>I think the following quote, referring to a “missionaries and
cannibal” solving program, is impressive. The program tries several
solutions and prefers those making progress towards moving people
to the other side of the river. An outsider can tell the program if
its making progress or not. This sounds to me like <a href=
"/notes/machine_learning/">machine learning</a>, which was in its
early days at the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some other function may have been modified so that, in certain
situations, “progress” won’t get to evaluate the situation at all,
and someone might get eaten anyway. If that happened, the outsider
would try to guess why.</p>
<p>He would have the options (1) of thoroughly understanding the
existing program and “really fixing” the trouble, or (2) of
entering anew advice statement describing what he imagines to be
the defective situation and telling the program not to move the
missionary into the position of being eaten. When a program grows
in power by an evolution of partially‑understood patches and fixes,
the programmer begins to lose track of internal details and can no
longer predict what will happen—and begins to hope instead of know,
watching the program as though it were an individual of
unpredictable behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="programming-is-more-than-a-bunch-of-instructions">
Programming is more than a bunch of instructions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In each domain of uncertainty I am at liberty to specify
(instead of particular procedures) procedure‑generators, selection
rules, courts of advice concerning choices, etc. So the behavior
can have wide ranges‑it need never twice follow the same lines, it
can be made to cover roughly the same latitude of tolerance that
lies in the author’s mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A programmer, by giving instructions, is specifying a frame in
which a program will develop. I believe most very interesting
programs are actually creating something new that can be of
interest to the programmer itself.</p>
<p>Data analysis is a simple form of this phenomenon. A programmer
writes some code to extract word frequency from a piece of text,
and get some insights he could not have got before. I believe that
<a href="/notes/open_ended_evolution/">open-ended evolution</a>
would be the ultimate form of a program impressing the programmer.
Though only evolving within the frame imposed by the programmer,
such a program would create endless and more complex novelty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To take advantage of the unsurpassed flexibility of this medium
requires tremendous skill‑technical, intellectual, and esthetic. To
constrain the behavior of a program precisely to a range may be
very hard, just as a writer will need some skill to express just a
certain degree of ambiguity. A computer is like a violin. You can
imagine a novice trying first a phonograph and then a violin. The
latter, he says, sounds terrible. That is the argument we have
heard from our humanists and most of our computer scientists.
Computer programs are good, they say, for particular purposes, but
they aren’t flexible. Neither is a violin, or a typewriter, until
you learn how to use it.</p>
