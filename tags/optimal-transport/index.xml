      <description>This post was largely inspired by Gabriel Peyré and Marco Cuturi&amp;rsquo;s excellent book about Computational Optimal Transport, which is free, (arXiv link, ref: [1]).
A simple problem? Let&amp;rsquo;s start at the beginning: what is Optimal transport (OT)?
It all begins with Gaspard Monge, reading his mémoire [2] in front of eminent scientists and engineers of the time &amp;mdash; including famous Enlightenment philosopher Condorcet &amp;mdash; at the French Académie Royale des Sciences in 1776.</description>

      <description>Links  Project slides PDF project report Github  Description This project was part of the course Mathematical Foundations Of Data Science taught by Gabriel Peyré in 2019.
The goal was to reproduce and extend results from [1] to other optimization algorithms, including SAGA [2]. After comparing the regularized optimal transport convergence results for these algorithms, I studied an optimal school placement and allocation problem in several French regions.</description>

      <description>Github repo  Description This project was about creating a tool similar to Arxiv Sanity with additional NLP functionalities for finding similar papers from their abstract.
I used a concept from [1], which uses earth mover&amp;rsquo;s distance metric between documents represented as normalized bag-of-words. The underlying transport cost between two words is given by their distance in a pre-trained word vector space. The app trains word vectors on all Arxiv abstracts and uses the EMD based metric to compute similarities between papers.</description>
