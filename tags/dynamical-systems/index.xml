Recurrent networks With Recurrent neural networks, the continuous dynamical system analogy is very striking. These networks evolve progressively in time by updating an internal state with a fixed algorithm. Usually the state dynamics are not studied because the recurrent networks is designed to complete some fixed task.
The notion of attractor can be defined for such networks, making them related to the notion of attractor networks.</description></item><item><title>Learning in dynamical systems</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/learning_in_dynamical_systems/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 12:56:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/learning_in_dynamical_systems/</guid><description> tags Machine learning, Dynamical systems resources (Weinan 2017) Bibliography E Weinan.

In the case of a cellular automaton on a grid of size \(n\) with \(k\) possible states per cell, the recurrence time is \(t_P = k^n\).</description></item></channel></rss>
