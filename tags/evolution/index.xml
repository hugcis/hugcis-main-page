However this seems to be fundamentally opposed to how natural evolution proceeds. Innovations appear without a priori objectives and it isn&amp;rsquo;t clear if setting such objectives for ourselves is slowing down progress by putting the focus on too narrow paths to a solution (Woolley, Stanley 2011; Stanley, Lehman 2015).</description></item><item><title>Notes on: Evolution in asynchronous cellular automata by Nehaniv, C. L. (2003)</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/nehanivevolutionasynchronouscellular2003/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2022 19:32:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/nehanivevolutionasynchronouscellular2003/</guid><description>tags Cellular automata, Evolution source (Nehaniv 2003) Summary This paper proposes a general asynchronous extension of CA rules and show that they can be made equivalent to the original CA rule. Applying this extension to H. Sayama&amp;rsquo;s Evoloop cellular automaton (Sayama 1999), the author creates the first asynchronous implementation of evolution of self-replicators.
One hope formulated by the author is that asynchronicity could help achieve fault-tolerance and self-repair which is something notoriously difficult to do in CA in general.</description></item><item><title>Open-ended creation of hybrid creatures with Neural Cellular Automata</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/blog/open-ended-creation-of-hybrid-creatures-with-neural-cellular-automata/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 15:25:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/blog/open-ended-creation-of-hybrid-creatures-with-neural-cellular-automata/</guid><description>This post describes my submission to the Minecraft Open-endedness challenge 2021. The submission was evaluated with the video below and the code here. This post will detail the methods and tools used for the submission and give hints for future work.
If you want a quick description of the work, have a look at the video:

One interesting advantage of this system is the possibility to measure the complexity of organisms easily. This is done by counting the number of instructions in their computer program.</description></item><item><title>Notes on: A model of urban evolution based on innovation diffusion by Raimbault, J. (2020)</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/raimbaultmodelurbanevolution2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 09:58:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/raimbaultmodelurbanevolution2020/</guid><description>source (Raimbault 2020) tags ALife 2020, Complex Systems, Evolution, Urban science Summary This paper studies the concept of innovation diffusion and how this could be seen as a way cities evolve.
Modeling this enables finding that global integration of cities (fully connected city graph on a territory) is not optimal for efficiently diffusing innovation that can spontaneously appear in any city.
I am interested in taking an ALife inspired approach to studying cities, as it can show cities as they could be.</description></item><item><title>Quality diversity</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/quality_diversity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 09:58:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/quality_diversity/</guid><description>tags Evolution, Reinforcement learning, Search algorithms papers (Pugh et al. 2016; Cully, Demiris 2017) QD is about creating algorithms that favor diversity in searching the space. In QD, one needs to both:
Measure the quality of a solution Have a way to describe the effect of a solution Solutions in QD have to be good in the two above ways.
QD is also a form of novelty search.</description></item><item><title>Notes on: A new structurally dissolvable self-reproducing loop evolving in a simple cellular automata space by Sayama, H. (1999)</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/sayamanewstructurallydissolvable1999/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 09:57:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/sayamanewstructurallydissolvable1999/</guid><description>source (Sayama 1999) tags Cellular automata, Evolution Summary This work presents a simple evolutionary system based on Langton&amp;rsquo;s self-reproducing loop. This is entirely done with a normal state-transition rule based CA. The initial structure of the loop was modified to catch variations. An interesting consequence of this system evolving is its natural tendency to evolve towards smaller loops despite no stochastic mutation being hard-coded.
