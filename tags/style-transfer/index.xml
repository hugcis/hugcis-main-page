      <description>Links  Project slides Project report  Description This project&amp;rsquo;s goal was to implement style transfer techniques based on GANs. We applied several algorithms on our own datasets of landscape pictures scraped from Flickr and frames from anime extracted automatically.
This project was a collaboration with Cl√©ment Acher and was part of the course Object recognition and computer vision taught by Jean Ponce, Ivan Laptev, Cordelia Schmid and Josef Sivic.</description>
