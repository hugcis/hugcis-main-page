A simple problem? Let&amp;rsquo;s start at the beginning: what is Optimal transport (OT)?
It all begins with Gaspard Monge, reading his mémoire [2] in front of eminent scientists and engineers of the time &amp;mdash; including famous Enlightenment philosopher Condorcet &amp;mdash; at the French Académie Royale des Sciences in 1776.</description></item><item><title>Data journalism extractor</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/projects/data_journalism_extractor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2018 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/projects/data_journalism_extractor/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="links">Links&lt;/h2>

I used a concept from [1], which uses earth mover&amp;rsquo;s distance metric between documents represented as normalized bag-of-words. The underlying transport cost between two words is given by their distance in a pre-trained word vector space. The app trains word vectors on all Arxiv abstracts and uses the EMD based metric to compute similarities between papers.</description></item></channel></rss>
