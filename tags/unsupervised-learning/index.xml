The most famous example is echo-state networks, which uses random recurrent neural networks as reservoirs, but other dynamical systems can also be used.
Reservoir computing with cellular automata Reservoir computing can use cellular automata as the reservoir.</description></item><item><title>Echo-state networks</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/echo_state_networks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2020 16:17:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/echo_state_networks/</guid><description>tags Recurrent neural networks, Unsupervised learning resources Scholarpedia Principle An echo state network is usually a standard RNN with fixed random weights. The output from this RNN is used as a high dimensional feature map to be fed into a machine learning system.
