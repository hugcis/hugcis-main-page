      <description>tags Physics, Statistical physics  Boltzmann brain Boltzmann brain is an interesting concept offered initially in response to one of Ludwig Boltzmann&amp;rsquo;s explanation for the low-entropy state of the Universe. He hypothesized that even a fully random universe would fluctuate towards lower-entropy states. The issue is that many phenomena such as evolved life on Earth are so far from equilibrium it looks like they were extremely unlikely to have happened.</description>
