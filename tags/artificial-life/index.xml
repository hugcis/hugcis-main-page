The first models that tried to construct ALife were probably Von Neumann&amp;rsquo;s self-reproducing CA and Langton&amp;rsquo;s loop. However, their main limitation was they were extremely brittle, which is why evolution did not really work in them.

(2021)</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/gershensonemergenceartificiallife2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 10:45:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/gershensonemergenceartificiallife2021/</guid><description>tags Artificial life, Emergence source (Gershenson 2021) Summary The paper introduces a complexity metric based on information. emergence is first measured with Shannon&amp;rsquo;s information: \[E = - K \sum_{i} p_i \log p_i\]
Then the author argues that self-organization can be seen as the opposite of emergence, and measured with \[S = 1 - E\]
[&amp;hellip;] complex systems tend to exhibit both emergence and self-organization. Extreme emergence implies chaos, while extreme self-organization implies immutability.</description></item><item><title>Emergence in artificial life</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/emergence_in_artificial_life/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 14:23:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/emergence_in_artificial_life/</guid><description> tags Artificial life, Emergence resources (Gershenson 2021) Bibliography Gershenson, Carlos.

One interesting advantage of this system is the possibility to measure the complexity of organisms easily. This is done by counting the number of instructions in their computer program.</description></item><item><title>Notes on: Combinatory Chemistry: Towards a Simple Model of Emergent Evolution by Kruszewski, G., &amp; Mikolov, T.

Combinatory logic is used as a basis for this system. Conservation laws are added on top of the set of rules that make combinatory logic Turing complete. This is then used to observe interesting dynamics and pre-life-like processes.
