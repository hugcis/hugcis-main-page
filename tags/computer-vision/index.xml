Since both these notions may be considered subjective, the problem of style transfer is not well defined and may be approached in many ways.
Style transfer with CNNs This is an early example of style transfer with convolutional neural networks: (Gatys et al. 2016)</description></item><item><title>Style transfer with generative adversarial neural networks</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/projects/style_transfer_gans/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019 15:14:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/projects/style_transfer_gans/</guid><description>Links Project slides Description This project&amp;rsquo;s goal was to implement style transfer techniques based on GANs. We applied several algorithms on our own datasets of landscape pictures scraped from Flickr and frames from anime extracted automatically.
This project was a collaboration with Cl√©ment Acher and was part of the course Object recognition and computer vision taught by Jean Ponce, Ivan Laptev, Cordelia Schmid and Josef Sivic.</description></item></channel></rss>
