This app tracks my location, but instead of sending it to Google or any other big corporation, it sends it to my private server running Roverland.
As I&amp;rsquo;m writing this, I have been tracking my location for seven months. My whole location history only takes up 43Mb once compressed.</description></item><item><title>My Org Roam Notes Workflow</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/blog/my-org-roam-notes-workflow/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 10:40:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/blog/my-org-roam-notes-workflow/</guid><description>Edit 2022-04-20: I did not see it right away, but there was a significant spike in the logs due to this post hitting the front page of Hacker News!

Some people expressed interest in my org roam notes workflow. Setting this up has been an interesting project, teaching me about Emacs, org-mode and a little about web frontend. This post will describe my current workflow in as much details as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
