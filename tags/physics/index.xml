If we were to understand and model all those laws we could explain any given phenomenon by breaking it down into its smaller parts until we just need to apply these simple laws.
With the current state of physics, it seems we are close to understanding many of these fundamental laws (although major shortcomings remain in the theory).</description></item><item><title>Zuse's thesis</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/zuse_s_thesis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 09:58:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/zuse_s_thesis/</guid><description>tags Physics, Philosophy resources Juergen Schmidhuber&amp;rsquo;s page, (Schmidhuber 1999) Zuse&amp;rsquo;s thesis is the idea that the Universe could be running within a digital computer. It was formulated by Konrad Zuse in Rechnender Raum (Calculating Space) in 1969. The computer could be a very large Cellular automaton according to Zuse.
A computer program to simulate our Universe (and all the others) Systematically create and execute all programs for a universal computer, such as a Turing machine or a CA; the first program is run for one instruction every second step on average, the next for one instruction every second of the remaining steps on average, and so on.</description></item><item><title>Attractor networks</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/attractor_networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 11:24:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/attractor_networks/</guid><description>tags Physics, Applied maths, Neural networks resources Scholarpedia Attractor networks are sets of nodes connected in such a way that their dynamics are stable in a small subspace of their phase space. The network state usually resides on this smaller manifold after a few evolution steps.
These networks are often recurrent.</description></item><item><title>Diffusion limited aggregation</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/diffusion_limited_aggregation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 09:58:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/diffusion_limited_aggregation/</guid><description> tags Applied maths, Physics</description></item><item><title>Dynamical systems</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/dynamical_systems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2020 20:26:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/dynamical_systems/</guid><description> tags Applied maths, Physics</description></item><item><title>Santa Fe Institute</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/santa_fe_institute/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2020 22:31:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/santa_fe_institute/</guid><description> tags Complex Systems, Physics</description></item><item><title>Morphogenesis</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/morphogenesis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 08:20:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/morphogenesis/</guid><description> tags Biological life, Physics</description></item><item><title>Reaction-diffusion</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/reaction_diffusion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2020 10:05:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/reaction_diffusion/</guid><description> tags Physics, Morphogenesis</description></item><item><title>Statistical physics</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/statistical_physics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 14:29:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/statistical_physics/</guid><description> tags Physics, Statistics</description></item><item><title>Boltzmann brain</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/boltzmann_brain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 10:20:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/boltzmann_brain/</guid><description>tags Physics, Statistical physics Boltzmann brain Boltzmann brain is an interesting concept offered initially in response to one of Ludwig Boltzmann&amp;rsquo;s explanation for the low-entropy state of the Universe. He hypothesized that even a fully random universe would fluctuate towards lower-entropy states. The issue is that many phenomena such as evolved life on Earth are so far from equilibrium it looks like they were extremely unlikely to have happened.</description></item><item><title>Chaos</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/chaos/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 08:45:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/chaos/</guid><description>tags Physics Chaos is a striking example of emergence. Deterministic equations of motions lead to completely unpredictable over time. Randomness has emerged from these deterministic laws.
From (Crutchfield 1994):
Where in the determinism did the randomness come from? The answer is that the effective dynamic, which maps from initial conditions to states at a later time, becomes so complicated that an observer can neither measure the system accurately enough nor compute with sufficient power to predict the future behavior when given an initial condition.</description></item><item><title>Ising model</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/ising_model/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2020 11:12:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/ising_model/</guid><description> tags Complex Systems, Physics</description></item></channel></rss>
