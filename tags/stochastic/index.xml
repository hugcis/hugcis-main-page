      <description>Links  Project slides PDF project report Github  Description This project was part of the course Mathematical Foundations Of Data Science taught by Gabriel Peyré in 2019.
The goal was to reproduce and extend results from [1] to other optimization algorithms, including SAGA [2]. After comparing the regularized optimal transport convergence results for these algorithms, I studied an optimal school placement and allocation problem in several French regions.</description>
