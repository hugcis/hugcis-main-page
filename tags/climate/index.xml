It was first described in W. S. Jenvons' book The Coal question in 1865.
It is closely to another paradox well known in road planning (Downsâ€“Thomson paradox) and Wirth&amp;rsquo;s law in software engineering.</description></item><item><title>Kaya identity</title><link>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/kaya_identity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 08:24:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://hugocisneros.com/notes/kaya_identity/</guid><description>tags Climate Definition It was developed by Japanese economist Yoichi Kaya.
\(F\) is global CO2 emissions from human sources, \(P\) is global population, \(G\) is GPD, \(E\) is global energy consumption. \[ F = P \times \frac{G}{P} \times \frac{E}{G} \times \frac{F}{E} \]
The fractional terms correspond to well studied quantities:
\(G/P\) is the GDP per capita \(E/G\) is the energy intensity of the GDP \(F/E\) is the carbon footprint of energy Interpretation This identity is simply a rewrite of \(F=F\) in terms of commonly used quantities to highlight several levers one could act on to reduce CO2 emissions.</description></item></channel></rss>
